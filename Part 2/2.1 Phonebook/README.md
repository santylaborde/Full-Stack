# Phonebook

Let's create a simple phonebook. In this part, we will only be adding names to the phonebook.

Let us start by implementing the addition of a person to the phonebook.

Prevent the user from being able to add names that already exist in the phonebook.

Expand your application by allowing users to add phone numbers to the phone book.

Implement a search field that can be used to filter the list of people by name.
