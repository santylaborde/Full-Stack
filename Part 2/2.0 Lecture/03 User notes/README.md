# User Notes

Let's continue expanding our application by allowing users to add new notes.

To get our page to update when new notes are added it's best to store the notes in the App component's state.

Next, let's add an HTML form to the component that will be used for adding new notes.

Let's add some new functionality to our application that allows us to only view the important notes.

Next, let's add functionality that enables users to toggle the showAll state of the application from the user interface.
