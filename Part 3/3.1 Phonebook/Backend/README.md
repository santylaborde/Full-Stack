# Phonebook Backend

Implement a Node application that returns a hardcoded list of phonebook entries from the address 
> http://localhost:3001/api/persons.

The application must be started with the command npm start and must also offer an npm run dev command.

Implement a page at the address http://localhost:3001/info.
The page has to show the time that the request was received and how many entries are in the phonebook at the time of processing the request.
