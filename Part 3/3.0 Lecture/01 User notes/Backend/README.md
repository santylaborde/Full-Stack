# User Notes Backend
In this part, our focus shifts towards the backend: that is, towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack.

We will be building our backend on top of NodeJS, which is a JavaScript runtime based on Google's Chrome V8 JavaScript engine.

Our goal is to implement a backend that will work with the notes application from part 2.
