# Blog List

In the exercises for this part, we will be building a blog list application, that allows users to save information about interesting blogs they have stumbled across on the internet. For each listed blog we will save the author, title, URL, and amount of upvotes from users of the application.

You receive an email that contains the following application body and instructions.
Turn the application into a functioning npm project. To keep your development productive, configure the application to be executed with nodemon.

Refactor the application into separate modules as shown earlier in this part of the course material.


### Helper Functions and Unit Tests
First, define a dummy function that receives an array of blog posts as a parameter and always returns the value 1. Verify that your test configuration works.
